# Music Player

App was made for a School assignment and is based on the .NET MAUI framework.

There are 3 songs that are locali stored and are hardcoded into the app, the reason been that I couldn't figure out how to make a "Play List" using the CommunityToolkit.Maui.MediaElement(https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui).
